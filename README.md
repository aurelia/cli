> **Note:** The CLI is currently in Alpha and as such may not be suitable for use on all projects yet. In particular, projects that need to make use of extensive 3rd party libraries or Aurelia plugins may not yet work or may require extensive custom configuration or workarounds. We are in the process of addressing these issues.

## Documentation

You can read documentation on the cli [here](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/the-aurelia-cli). If you would like to help improve this documentation, the source for the above can be found in the doc folder within the framework repository.
