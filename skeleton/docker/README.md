## Build for Docker

This is as simple as running a command:

`yarn docker:build` or `npm run docker:build`

if you want to bring up an instance on your machine run:

`yarn docker:start` or `npm run docker:build`

to stop the previously started instance:

`yarn docker:stop` or `npm run docker:stop`
